2. **Desccription:** 
    - Developed an interactive card interface featuring five distinct cat images. 
    - When a user hovers over a card, the cat's name appears vertically aligned.
    - Upon clicking, the selected card expands to reveal the full image, enhancing visual engagement.

3. **Purpose**: 
    - To present content in a visually appealing and interactive way. 
    - This allows users to engage with the information presented on the card by expanding and collapsing it with a click or hover action, enhancing user experience and engagement on a webpage.

2. **Description:** 
    - Created a multi-step progress indicator with four steps, each representing a different cat emotion.
    - The progress starts at step 1, where the "Previous" button is disabled. At step 4, the "Next" button is disabled.
    - Users navigate through the steps, with each step visually represented by a unique cat emoji.

3. **Purpose:** 
    - To visually guide users through a multi-step process, helping them track their progress and understand their current position in a sequence of tasks or actions.
    - To enhance user experience by providing clear navigation and feedback, improving usability and completion rates.
